Cleanup: Gamifying Beautification

Users login to create, view, and interact with local meetups to clean public lands, such as parks, trails, and community centers. Users can schedule and promote a Cleanup of their own, or join one that's already planned. Users can also vote and comment on any past Cleanups. Users that plan or engage with Cleanups are rewarded points that can be used to claim various rewards.
